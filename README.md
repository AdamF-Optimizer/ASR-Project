# Explanation
This repository contains 2 folders. The "Standard Version" folder runs the training once, then evalates. The "K-Fold Version" folder extends upon the "Standard Version" by performing K-Fold cross validation.
The notebooks can be uploaded and run in your favorite notebook editor, Jupyter, or Google Colab.
